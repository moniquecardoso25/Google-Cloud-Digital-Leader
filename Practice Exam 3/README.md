### 01 - You are migrating workloads to the cloud. The goal of the migration is to serve customers worldwide as quickly as possible According to local regulations, certain data is required to be stored in a specific geographic area, and it can be served worldwide. You need to design the architecture and deployment for your workloads. What should you do?

`Select a public cloud provider that guarantees data location in the required geographic area.`

Explanation:
Select a public cloud provider that guarantees data location in the required geographic area


### 02 - Your organization needs a large amount of extra computing power within the next two weeks. After those two weeks, the need for the additional resources will end. Which is the most cost-effective approach?

`Start a very powerful virtual machine without using a committed use discount.`

Explanation:
C is correct because we donâ€™t know the compute use for 2 weeks and discount is available on 1-3 years not for 2 weeks.

### 03 - Your organization needs to plan its cloud infrastructure expenditures. Which should your organization do?

`Review cloud resource costs frequently, because costs change often based on use.`

Explanation:
A. Review cloud resource costs frequently, because costs change often based on use.

### 04 - The operating systems of some of your organization's virtual machines may have a security vulnerability. How can your organization most effectively identify all virtual machines that do not have the latest security update?

`View the Security Command Center to identify virtual machines running vulnerable disk images.`

Explanation:
You can filter findings by detector name and finding type using the Security Command Center Vulnerabilities tab in the Google Cloud console


### 05 - You are currently managing workloads running on Windows Server for which your company owns the licenses. Your workloads are only needed during working hours, which allows you to shut down the instances during the weekend. Your Windows Server licenses are up for renewal in a month, and you want to optimize your license cost. What should you do?

 `Migrate the workloads to Compute Engine with a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model.`

Explanation:
License cost will be reduced / eliminated if you go with "D" option. You don't need BYOL as the license is going to expire soon anyway. If license were for another year or so, then BYOL would have been the choice.

### 06 - Your organization runs a distributed application in the Compute Engine virtual machines. Your organization needs redundancy, but it also needs extremely fast communication (less than 10 milliseconds) between the parts of the application in different virtual machines. Where should your organization locate this virtual machines?

'In different zones within a single region'.

Explanation:
Since it guarantees a latency of ~10 milliseconds is maintained, well also giving the redundancy of multi-zone. If it was D, we could not guarantee 10 milliseconds between the different regions.


### 07 - An organization decides to migrate their on-premises environment to the cloud. They need to determine which resource components still need to be assigned ownership. Which two functions does a public cloud provider own? (Choose two.)

'Hardware maintenance'
'Hardware capacity management'

Explanation:
A & D. CSP is generally responsible for the maintenance of all its hardware. Whereas customer is responsible for how the application-side is run in those hardware.

### 08 - You are a program manager within a Software as a Service (SaaS) company that offers rendering software for animation studios. Your team needs the ability to allow scenes to be scheduled at will and to be interrupted at any time to restart later. Any individual scene rendering takes less than 12 hours to complete, and there is no service-level agreement (SLA) for the completion time for all scenes. Results will be stored in a global Cloud Storage bucket. The compute resources are not bound to any single geographical location. This software needs to run on Google Cloud in a cost-optimized way.
What should you do?

'Deploy the application on Compute Engine using preemptible instances'

Explanation:
Can be interrupted at any time to restart later, software needs to run on Google Cloud in a cost-optimized way

### 09 - Your manager wants to restrict communication of all virtual machines with internet access; with resources in another network; or with a resource outside Compute Engine. It is expected that different teams will create new folders and projects in the near future. How would you restrict all virtual machines from having an external IP address?

'Define an organization policy at the root organization node to restrict virtual machine instances from having an external IP address'

Explanation:

### 10 - Your multinational organization has servers running mission-critical workloads on its premises around the world. You want to be able to manage these workloads consistently and centrally, and you want to stop managing infrastructure. What should your organization do?

'Migrate the workloads to a public cloud'

Explanation:
A is correct. Key is manage centrally. Manage these workloads consistently and centrally, and you want to stop managing infrastructure.
